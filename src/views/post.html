                    <p>The housing crisis – this term is bandied about a lot, but what does it actually mean? Simply put, there is a chronic housing shortage in the UK, particularly affordable housing. This has resulted in years of rapidly rising house prices, locking a whole generation of young people out of home ownership: Generation Rent. Over 50% of 20-39 year olds are currently renting, with this only set to rise. On top of this, rents, especially in the capital, are increasing at alarming rates.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading fadein" ng-show="main.showContent">So why is London so unaffordable?</h2>
                    <p class="fadein" ng-show="main.showContent">The simple answer is that too few houses are being built at fast enough rates and of those that are built, not enough are affordable. The financial crash of 2007-2008 stunted the growth of the construction industry and has lead to a skills shortage with the departure of around 250,000 workers, according to Patrick Law of Barratt Developments. And even when a site is granted for construction, the planning process is slow. Whilst 1000 pages of government planning policy has been cut to 50 in an attempt to speed up decision making, there have been consistent cuts to planning departments, meaning that not only is the process slow, but it is left open to manipulation by powerful property developers with the means available to combat council restrictions and social housing quotas, giving them free reign over the type of housing they build.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading" ng-show="main.showContent">So, what is being done by the government to combat the housing crisis?</h2>
                    <p class="fadein" ng-show="main.showContent">
                      The answer is: not enough. The government has pledged to build 400,000 affordable homes by 2021, including 200,000 ‘Starter Homes’ for first-time buyers, but the Barker Report in 2004 recommended that at least 245,000 homes a year needed to be built keep house-price inflation at the 1.1% European average, a target that successive governments have consistently failed to meet.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fadein" ng-show="main.showContent">There was no mention in the 2016 Budget of any measures to tackle house price inflation. Furthermore, the 3% rise in stamp duty on buy-to-let properties will ultimately lead to higher rents, impacting the increasing numbers of renters and making it much harder for them to save for deposits to buy their own homes. The new Lifetime ISA proposed in the Budget is designed to combat this, allowing people to pay in up to £4,000 a year, receiving a 25% bonus from the government on whatever they save. It sounds too good to be true, and it is. When the average deposit for a first time buyer is 17%, it will still take people years to save enough to afford their first home. In addition, expanding people’s purchasing power won’t fix the basic problem of lack of supply. According to the Office of Budget Responsibility, increasing demand for property when levels of home-building are at their lowest peacetime levels in nearly a century will only further drive up house prices, which are already set to rise by 50% over the next 10 years.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive fadein" src="src/img/brixton-building-site.JPG" alt="" ng-show="main.showContent">
                    <p class="fadein" ng-show="main.showContent">The Housing and Planning Bill, currently at committee stage in the House of Lords, is even worse. It contains proposals to redefine what constitutes ‘affordable housing’ to include homes costing up to £450,000. This means that in practice, many of the government’s so called ‘affordable’ Starter Homes will be out of reach for many first-time buyers. In addition, these ‘affordable’ homes will be built in place of council houses, with many campaigners warning that this Bill will be the death of social housing. Shelter have predicted that it will result in 180,000 fewer affordable homes available to rent and buy over the next five years. This is on top of the fact that council regulations on social housing are consistently bypassed by property developers through monetary contributions and legal loopholes regarding viability appraisals, resulting in a devastating shortage of social housing.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading" ng-show="main.showContent">So what are the results of all this?</h2>
                    <p class="fadein" ng-show="main.showContent">House prices are rising, obviously, but so are rents, particularly in London. According to the HomeLet Rental Index, rents have risen by 7.7% in the last year, compared to the UK average of 4.8%. This is at a time when more and more people are forced to rent due to soaring house prices. A recent report by PwC has predicted that 60% of London residents will be renting by 2025, compared with the situation in 2000, when 60% of Londoners owned their own home. Young people are those hit hardest by the current crisis. Despite efforts by the government to create a nation of homeowners, only 26% of people aged 20-39 will own their own home by 2025, as opposed to those born in 1960 and 1970, 64% of whom owned their own house by the time they were 35.</p>
                    <p ng-show="main.showContent">Rising house prices, rising rents: the picture is indeed bleak for Generation Rent. No wonder over 25% of us still live with our parents. And unless significant efforts are made to expand the stock of affordable housing, it looks like things will only continue to get worse.</p>
